# Tech Blog

## Description

Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. This project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The site is built using Handlebars.js for the frontend, Sequelize ORM for the backend, and uses Express.js to create RESTful API routes. It also features authentication via `express-session` to log in and manage posts and comments.
